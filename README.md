**RPrime-Function**
>This a function that is essentially an infinite sum series involving the prime numbers. This series seems to converge to a value around *1.7052301717918*. This series doesn't seem to be known in the math community, so I named the RPrime-Function (reciprocal-prime-function).
>The function definition can be stated as follows:
F = 1 + 1/p₁ + 1/(p₁⋅p₂) + 1/(p₁⋅p₂⋅p₃) + 1/(p₁⋅p₂⋅p₃⋅...⋅pₙ) 
Where:
p₁, p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ are the prime numbers in ascending order, 
with p₁ being the first prime number, p₂ being the second prime number, and so on.
