**RPrime-Function**
>
This a function that is essentially an infinite sum series involving the prime numbers. This series seems to converge to a value around *1.7052301717918*. This series doesn't seem to be known in the math community, so I named the RPrime-Function (reciprocal-prime-function).

The function can be defined as follows:

$$
R(n) = \sum \frac{1}{p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n}
Where {p_n} is the {nth} prime number.
$$
